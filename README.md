### üîç Project Overview

This repository demonstrates the application of K-Means clustering to segment bank customers. By analyzing customer attributes such as age, account balance, and transaction history, the project identifies distinct customer groups. These segments can be leveraged to tailor marketing efforts, enhance customer experience, and optimize product offerings.([GitHub][2], [GitHub][3])
